# Data Science stack server
This set of "bootstrap" scripts are designed to automatically install on a raw server the necessary stack (set of services) necessary for a Data Scientist to work (or at least me)
All the IDE are cloud-based and are :

- Some basics Unix tool & helpers
- Nginx
- ![Jupyterhub](https://github.com/JeanLescut/DataScience_stack_server/blob/master/04_jupyterhub/root/var/www/html/res/logos/jupyterhub.png =250x) Jupyterhub, Anaconda and Python 3
- ![RStudio](https://github.com/JeanLescut/DataScience_stack_server/blob/master/05_rstudio/root/var/www/html/res/logos/rstudio.png) R and R Studio
- ![Spark](https://github.com/JeanLescut/DataScience_stack_server/blob/master/06_spark/root/var/www/html/res/logos/spark.png) Spark
- ![Shell-in-a-box](https://github.com/JeanLescut/DataScience_stack_server/blob/master/07_shellinabox/root/var/www/html/res/logos/shellinabox.png) Shell-in-a-box, a cloud-based Terminal server
- ![Codiad](https://github.com/JeanLescut/DataScience_stack_server/blob/master/08_codiad/root/var/www/html/res/logos/codiad.png) Codiad and gc++ compiler for C++ development

Even if it looks like `install.sh` can do all the work alone, I recommend to follow the scripts step by step.

I used these scripts to configure my "Luke" Personal Server
