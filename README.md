# Data Science stack server
This set of "bootstrap" scripts are designed to automatically install on a raw server the necessary stack (set of services) necessary for a Data Scientist to work (or at least me)
All the IDE are cloud-based and are :

- Some basics Unix tool & helpers
- Nginx
- **Jupyterhub, Anaconda and Python 3**
- **R and R Studio**
- **Spark**
- Shell-in-a-box, a cloud-based Terminal server
- Codiad and gc++ compiler for C++ development (to be used for the most adventurous of us !)

Even if it looks like `install.sh` can do all the work alone, I recommend to follow the scripts step by step.
Note: I used these scripts to configure my "Luke" Personal Server
