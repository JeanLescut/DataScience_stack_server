This repo contains the basis for installing a cloud server, mostly data-science oriented since containing :

- Nginx
- Jupyterhub, Anaconda and Python 3
- R and R Studio
- Codiad and gc++ compiler for C++ development

Even if it looks like `install.sh` can do all the work alone, I recommend to follow the scripts step by step.
