# server_initialization_scripts

This repo contains the basis for installing a cloud server, mostly data-science oriented since containing :

- Nginx
- Jupyterhub, Anaconda and Python 3
- R and R Studio
- Codiad and gc++ compiler for C++ development

Even if it looks like `install.sh` can do all the work alone, it is **strongly** recommanded to follow the scripts step by step.

The scripts are supposed to run on top of a Ubuntu server 15, but can be used on any Ubuntu and supposely Debian...

I will add more services and improve code over time. Enjoy :)
